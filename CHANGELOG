Slax 7.0.6 (13th of March 2013)

- Upgraded to Linux Kernel 3.8.2
- Upgraded KDE to version 4.10.1
- Fixed missing notification when module is activated or deactivated
- Upgraded all packages to reflect changes in Slackware-current
- Show date on taskbar under current time
- Updated FireFox to 19.0.2
- The device notifier in KDE is now hidden since it was showing on mad positions. KDE bug has been submitted, nobody cares, so I hid it.


Slax 7.0.5 (27th of January 2013)

- added udev rules to make X cursor use vmmouse driver if Slax is
  running in vmware. This enables automatic grab/ungrab of the cursor by
  the virtual machine.

- ksnapshot now fedaults to "Window under cursor" capture more, and
  supports "sending" the screenshot directly to Slax server (using
  'Share Image' option in the Send actions). When selected, it asks
  for Slax module name to which the screenshot should be assigned.
  All submitted screenshots will be reviewed by a moderator, of course.

- KDE configured to require password when X restarts.

- Updated to KDE 4.9.5

- Upgraded to FireFox 18.0.1

- Improved functionality of Slax activate/deactivate



Slax 7.0.4 (15th of January 2013)

- better bootinst.sh compatibility with ubuntu and clones

- PXE now tries to get Slax data over TFTP (from the same server)
  if http connection to port 7529 fails

- added support for load= and noload= boot parameters which act as
  regex filters

- fixed korean support (added missing font to korean module)

- fixed URL open in KDE (using %u in exec command in firefox.desktop).
  Thanks to Manfred M. <http://www.fluxflux.net/>

- fixed a bug when using from=... to load Slax from a path which
  included a directory with only two letters, like /os/

- support for special files in Slax Bundles. Content of file
  /run/activate.sh gets executed on activate, content of
  /run/deactivate.sh gets executed on module deactivation.
  File attributes don't matter at all.

- the autobuild system now adds a file /run/requires to all modules
  which require other modules. This file is used by 'slax activate'
  command to activate all dependencies automatically.

- even more improved X autodetection. Tries to fallback to modesetting
  driver if X -configure fails to produce a working xorg.conf file,
  and fallbacks to vesa driver if modesetting is not available.

- deactivate of Slax module now removes the module file, unless
  you deactivate it with the real filename as argument - then it is kept

- added unRAR support (compiled from official unrar sources)

- provide rightclick menu option to activate / deactivate Slax bundles

- hide loop devices from showing in dolphin by udev rule

- buildscript now requires description, it is no longer optional



Slax 7.0.3 (2nd of January 2013)

- added PXE server and client support. Run 'pxe' command to start
  the PXE server on Slax

- added dnsmasq in preparation for PXE functionality

- added httpd support to busybox

- improved X autodetection by calling X -configure if default
  configuration fails

- added xev, a simple yet useful command to list code of pressed key, so
  one can remap it later using xmodmap

- bashrc file has been fixed to properly show current directory on
  command prompt

- fixed cleanup of 'slax' script (remove temporary files from /tmp)

- fixed buildscipt checks to allow required bundles with + and _
  characters in name

- added PDF file with Slax documentation

- fixed deb2sb (and deb2txz) script to properly unpack lzma-compressed
  debian package content, thanks to Manfred M. <http://www.fluxflux.net/>

- slax activate now runs kbuildsycoca4 to regenerate KDE menu if
  *.desktop files are detected in the bundle, thanks to Manfred M.

- include mc.sh in bashrc so midnight commander remembers last directory
  on restart, thanks to Manfred M. <http://www.fluxflux.net/>
