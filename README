How to build Slax:

First of all, this is not meant for public use. It's my own scripts.
You can use them, but don't expect much help from me :) Everything
is undocummented here (yet self-explanatory since it's a bash script).

- in all cases, install current kernel version to the build system and reboot
- install imagemagick and copy helpers/gzip0.php to path so it's executable
- edit ./build script to make adjustments for paths to Slackware DVD tree
- the same for slax packages, can find them on ftp.slax.org (http access only)
- this build system just creates .sb modules, so when you have them, download 
  linux live kit and make directory ./sb in it, put all newly created modules
  to it, copy bootfiles/* over livekit bootfiles and adjust .config file
  in livekit to reflect slax name
